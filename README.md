# Offensive Security in Mobile Applications


## Overview
This repository showcases a comprehensive offensive security assessment of mobile applications with a focus on Android and iOS platforms. The project aims to identify, exploit, and document vulnerabilities to enhance mobile application security. Key objectives include platform-specific analysis, penetration testing frameworks, and real-world exploitation techniques.

## Key Features
- **Platform-Specific Analysis**: Unique security challenges in Android and iOS.
- **Penetration Testing Frameworks**: Custom frameworks for static and dynamic analysis.
- **Buffer Overflow Exploitation**: Advanced memory handling attack simulations.
- **CVE and CWE Analysis**: Evaluation of recent vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
- **Red Team vs Blue Team Simulation**: Offensive and defensive security strategies.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Android Studio
- iOS Development Environment (Xcode)
- Security tools: Metasploit, Nessus, Frida, Burp Suite

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OffensiveSecurityMobile.git
   cd OffensiveSecurityMobile
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the environment:
   - Configure Android and iOS emulators.
   - Deploy **InsecureBankv2** APK for testing.

## Features
### CO1: Offensive Security Techniques Analysis
- Platform-specific challenges (Android: Fragment Injection, WebView exploits; iOS: Jailbreak detection bypass).
- Cross-platform vulnerabilities (data storage, network communication, authentication).

### CO2: Android Penetration Testing Framework
- **Static Analysis**: APK decompilation using `jadx-gui`, `apktool`, and `dex2jar`.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime testing with Frida and SSL interception.

### CO3: Buffer Overflow Exploitation
- Integration with Metasploit for payload generation and custom exploit development.
- Vulnerability scanning using Nessus.

### CO4: CVE and CWE Analysis
- Analysis of CVEs like **CVE-2023-21002** and CWEs such as **CWE-89** (SQL Injection).

### CO5: Red Team and Blue Team Simulation
- Offensive techniques: SQL Injection, XSS, password attacks.
- Defensive measures: MFA, RBAC, SIEM deployment.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Languages**: Python, Java, Swift
- **Frameworks**: Metasploit, Frida
- **Testing Tools**: Nessus, Burp Suite
- **Hosting**: Local environment with Android Studio and Xcode

## How to Use
1. **Run Static Analysis**:  
   ```bash
   python src/android/static_analysis.py --apk path/to/InsecureBankv2.apk
   ```
2. **Dynamic Testing**:  
   Set up Frida:
   ```bash
   frida -U -n com.insecurebankv2
   ```
3. **Exploitation**:  
   Execute buffer overflow exploit using Metasploit:
   ```bash
   msfconsole -r exploits/android_overflow.rc
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement advanced threat detection using ML.
- Expand testing for additional CVEs and CWEs.
- Develop detailed training modules for security teams.
